<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retrievable IVC Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tethered Filter</li><li>Unrestricted-type Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filter market primarily comprises two types: tethered filters and unrestricted-type filters. Tethered filters are designed to be anchored within the IVC, providing stability while allowing for retrieval when no longer needed. In contrast, unrestricted-type filters can be deployed freely without anchoring mechanisms, offering flexibility in placement and retrieval. Both types are used to prevent pulmonary embolism, with specific advantages regarding ease of removal and adaptability to patient needs in varying clinical scenarios.</p></p>
