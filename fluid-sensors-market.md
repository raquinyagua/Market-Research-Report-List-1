<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluid Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Non-Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fluid sensors market is categorized into two main types: contact and non-contact sensors. Contact sensors directly interact with the fluid, measuring properties like temperature, pressure, and flow by being immersed or in contact with the liquid or gas. Non-contact sensors, however, detect fluid characteristics without physical interaction, utilizing technologies like ultrasonic, radar, or optical methods. Each type serves specific applications, with contact sensors often used in environments requiring precise measurements and non-contact sensors being beneficial in harsh or corrosive conditions.</p></p>
